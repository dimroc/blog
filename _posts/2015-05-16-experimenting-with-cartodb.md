Lately, I've been experimenting with a variety of mapping solutions. Starting with the barebones Leaflet (amazing), and then taking things a step
further with CartoDB. I've got all these tweets lying around from [New Tweet City](http://www.newtweetcity.com), so I figured I would put them to good use.

I was just in California, and people were all about [Coachella](http://www.coachella.com). On my return to NYC, I was curious which NYC neighborhoods cared the most about Coachella.
So I made the intensity map below:

The neighborhoods of FiDi and TriBeCa took that crown, to no surprise. They are some of the most affluent neighborhoods in NYC and I can see those residents hyping up Coachella.
Meanwhile, Washington Heights and northern Manhattan had little activity off and didn't really care too much to Coachella.

Below, you can clearly see how interest in [Coachella](http://www.coachella.com) spikes in the month of April, when the event occurs:

Over the next few months, I'll be plotting some more NYC data to glean insight into particular neighborhoods.
