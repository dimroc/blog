I made a killer trade the other day. And it came from a buy signal on a side project. Let me walk you through it.

I've been farming tweets from cities for years now. They've spun out into experimental projects like [Urban Events](/2015/12/29/search-across-cities/) and
[New Tweet City](/2014/09/24/tweets-as-pixels/). When investigating Twitter media, one thing that became apparent was that many tweets
were actually links to Instagram (IG) rather than Twitter images.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/HunterEliteGene">@HunterEliteGene</a> And your favorite level?</p>&mdash; Minibar Austin (@MinibarAustin) <a href="https://twitter.com/MinibarAustin/status/703329275970244611">February 26, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

In JSON format:

```
{
  "id": 703309386622615600,
  "text": "I captured every level of drunk last night üì∑üç∫ @ 6th Street, Austin, TX https://t.co/ZEspPWrfPR",
  "source": "<a href=\"http://instagram.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Instagram</a>",
  "entities": {
    "urls": [{
        "url": "https://t.co/ZEspPWrfPR",
        "display_url": "instagram.com/p/BCQx8Z3gNiC/" //Important!
      }]
  }
}
```

This tweet, despite being all text, contains media at the end of the tunnel. So I grabbed the Instagram image
and reclassified the tweet as `image` in my system:


```
{
  "id":"703309386622615553",
  "mediaType":"image", *Important*
  "mediaUrl":"https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/12724735_1711188682429506_1029304848_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTE5MzY3MzU1NjQ3NTU2NjIxMA%3D%3D.2.l", //instagram
  "text":"I captured every level of drunk last night üì∑üç∫..."
}
```

## How many Images are actually Instagram?

I knew a lot of the traffic were links to Instagram but I wasn't sure how much. All my tweets live in Elasticsearch, which has a data visualization
tool called [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana). It allowed me to chart what percentage of images were actually Instagram links.
Let's start with New York City and see what we have:

![Twitter NYC Stacked](/public/images/twitterbeatdastreet/TwitterNycImagesStacked.jpg)

Man that's a lot of Instagram. Let's check it out as a percentage.

![Twitter NYC Percentage](/public/images/twitterbeatdastreet/TwitterNycMediaSplit.jpg)

Peaked at 92%! So here's where I give you the disclaimer about which tweets I'm analyzing.
**This is only applicable to geotagged tweets with media.** After all, if it's not geotagged I can't tell if it's coming out of NYC.

Still. Let's take a look at some other cities:

![Twitter Cities Percentage](/public/images/twitterbeatdastreet/TwitterMediaOriginSplitsStacked.jpg)

Shout out to LA for **only having 64% of traffic from Instagram**. So on Twitter's best day, it only has 36% of images on
its own platform.

## How does Wall Street come in?

I've been getting fleeced by the [TWTR](https://www.google.com/finance?q=TWTR&ei=rxbTVvGnLNaNmAGo2q64Ag) stock for a while now, **even while having this knowledge months ago.**
I knew of this in the Summer of 2015, **when TWTR was $51 (it's now $17)**, and did nothing. I was reluctant to use the Twitter API as a buy or sell signal
on the stock. My finance world and my development world were completely distinct. And then this happened.

<img src="/public/images/twitterbeatdastreet/VennEpiphany.jpg" alt="Venn Epiphany" style="max-width: 400px; width: 100%;"/>

It seems obvious now, but I never went into my side projects to discover signals, and looking at the information, the perfect trade
would have been a pair trade shorting TWTR and buying FB (owner of Instagram). But I felt I had missed the boat on TWTR. I actually hadn't,
but I've been burned by bottom fishing before and I wasn't going to do that again. Not me, no sir.

Then in January, I landed on this [nugget of information about Instagram](http://blog.business.instagram.com/post/128686033016/150909-advertisinglaunch):

> We‚Äôre excited to announce that starting this month, advertisers both large and small can run campaigns on Instagram. In addition, ads are now available in more than 30 new countries‚Äîincluding Italy, Spain, Mexico, India and South Korea‚Äîand will be launching in markets around the world on Sept. 30.

September 30th 2015. This means that [FB Q4 Earnings](http://investor.fb.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=952040), released in January, was the first earnings release with IG ad revenue for a full quarter.
My, my are the stars aligning! Couple this with some napkin math on their estimates (**translation**: pure speculation), I was going in for the buy.

## Buying options for leverage right before earnings release

![Facebook Options Confirmation](/public/images/twitterbeatdastreet/FBOptionConfirmation.jpg)

It's not a game anymore. The options had a strike price of $99 and cost me just under $900 (that's all I risked, I know, don't tell me about it).

When the market bell closed on the 28th, [FB](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ%3AFB&ei=shbTVuHoJpazmAGNw5HQBQ) stock dipped to $94.50. GG y'all, üçª, this was fun.

But wait, then earnings were released. It spiked up to as high as $112. I waited until the next morning and I was out of there:

![Facebook Call Options BOOM](/public/images/twitterbeatdastreet/FacebookCallOptionsBOOM.jpg)

Exercising 300 FB shares became $32,748, I got my first margin call and needed to shore up cash. I just dumped the shares
and took home a profit of around $3k, just over 300% of the initial ~$900.

## Don't forget the context!

Remembering the context of all this is important. Before 2016, Twitter's outlook wasn't so bleak. In December 2014, a Twitter exec threw this [jab](http://fortune.com/2014/12/11/twitter-evan-williams-instagram/)

> Twitter co-founder Evan Williams: 'I don't give a shit' if Instagram has more users

Now add a finding that claims a majority of your `image` traffic belongs to your rival. Perhaps they'll say Twitter has
always been about the 140 character tweet. After pushing [Moments](http://money.cnn.com/2015/10/06/technology/twitter-moments/), unlikely.

## All of that for only $3K

It was by far the surest I had ever been that a stock would pop on earnings, and I was timid. I needed some Wolf of Wall Street that day
and I didn't have it. But you always say that after a successful trade. It was a great experience and I'm hoping that the stars
will align again, but I've accepted that it might not happen for months, quarters, or even years.
