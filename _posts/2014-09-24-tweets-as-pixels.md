What do you get when you brighten a pixel every time you get a tweet's location? That's what [Miguel Rios](https://blog.twitter.com/2013/the-geography-of-tweets) asked
in his post [The Geography of Tweets](https://blog.twitter.com/2013/the-geography-of-tweets).

Here's my very own rendering of NYC after gathering geotagged tweets in 2013:

Fascinating deductions:

* The gridded street blocks really pop out because of what I assume are pedestrians tweeting on the sidewalks.
* A lot of people tweet when they drive. Look closely and you can even see all the main bridges (Brooklyn, Williamsburgh, etc).
* The Staten Island Ferry near the bottom of the photo is an incident of tweets being sent over water.

Zooming into Manhattan, we can see the following:
