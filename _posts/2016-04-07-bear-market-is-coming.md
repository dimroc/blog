## Inability to stop deflation

Energy prices continue to tumble. We've gotten too good at producing it and the supply glut won't end anytime soon.

## Printing Money (QE) still can't stop the impending deflation

After 2008's mortgage crisis, the fed slashed rates to 0% and printed money. Market bounced back,

the invisible hand of the economy.

The cost of goods continue to dive, and so will prices, adding to the deflationary pressure. $5 Ubers, free international calling via Skype,

to force people to spend money.

I've taken short positions in BP and NOK.
