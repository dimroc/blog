2019's books were around idea generation, breadth of talent, and pop-intellectualism. Here are 9 books worth reading:

1. [The Origin of Wealth](https://smile.amazon.com/Origin-Wealth-Remaking-Economics-Business-ebook/dp/B077G7834G/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+origin+of+wealth&qid=1577976907&s=digital-text&sr=1-1)
    > Your shirt was not designed; it was evolved.

    * A thorough, academic book that shows how Darwin's Theory of Evolution is also applicable to products and the economy.
      > We are accustomed to thinking of evolution in a biological context, but modern evolutionary theory views evolution as something much more general. Evolution is an algorithm; it is an all-purpose formula for innovation, a formula that, through its special brand of trial and error, creates new designs and solves difficult problems.

    * Somewhat analogous to Christensen's "Innovator's Dilemma" and its theme of disruptive innovations versus evolutionary innovation. Times ebb and flow between burts of divergent ideas, only to see a handful succeed and grow in a period of convergence. These then become disrupted by a new period of divergence.
    > This book will argue that wealth creation is the product of a simple, but profoundly powerful, three-step formula—differentiate, select, and amplify—the formula of evolution.

    * Unfortunately, too heavy a read for most. The world would benefit from a concise Gladwell-ized version of the material. Heavy on economic theory and its comparison to other economic models.

    * Touches on the deeper meaning of wealth, that's often overlooked. Wealth is not just about how much money you have, but what your money can buy.

      > But it is not just the absolute level of income that makes New Yorkers so wealthy; it is also the incredible variety of things their wealth can buy. Imagine you had the income of a New Yorker, but you could only spend it on things in the Yanomamö economy. If you spent $36,000 fixing up your mud hut, buying the best clay pots in the village, and eating the finest Yanomamö cuisine, you would be extraordinarily wealthy by Yanomamö standards, but you would still feel far poorer than a typical New Yorker with his or her Nike sneakers, televisions, and vacations in Florida. The number of economic choices the average New Yorker has is staggering. The Wal-Mart near JFK Airport has over 100,000 different items in stock, there are over 200 television channels offered on cable TV, Barnes & Noble lists over 8 million titles, the local supermarket has 275 varieties of breakfast cereal, the typical department store offers 150 types of lipstick, and there are over 50,000 restaurants in New York City alone.

      > Thus, the most dramatic difference between the New Yorker and Yanomamö economies is not their “wealth” measured in dollars, a mere 400-fold difference, but rather the hundred-million-fold, or eight orders of magnitude difference in the complexity and diversity of the New Yorkers’ economy versus the Yanomamö economy.

1. [Range](https://smile.amazon.com/Range-Generalists-Triumph-Specialized-World-ebook/dp/B07H1ZYWTM/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=range&qid=1577974948&s=digital-text&sr=1-1)

    * A fantastic, pop-intellectual book that advocates the long term benefits of a broad skillset; namely _creative integration_.
    > Individual creators started out with lower innovativeness than teams—they were less likely to produce a smash hit—but as their experience broadened they actually surpassed teams: an individual creator who had worked in four or more genres was more innovative than a team whose members had collective experience across the same number of genres. Taylor and Greve suggested that “individuals are capable of more creative integration of diverse experiences than teams are.”

    * Range shows the diminishing returns of a deep skill set, and how Malcolm Gladwell's 10k hours is only potent in "kind" learning environments.
    > Kahneman was focused on the flip side of kind learning environments; Hogarth called them “wicked.” In wicked domains, the rules of the game are often unclear or incomplete, there may or may not be repetitive patterns and they may not be obvious, and feedback is often delayed, inaccurate, or both.

1. [Lateral Thinking](https://smile.amazon.com/Lateral-Thinking-Creativity-Step-ebook/dp/B003V1WTLI/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1577971237&sr=1-2)

    * After stumbling on a now favorite blog post about [Nintendo's Product Philosophy](https://medium.com/@adamagb/nintendo-s-little-known-product-philosophy-lateral-thinking-with-withered-technology-bac7257d8f4), I started to become
    obsessed with Lateral Thinking as a concept. In the blog post, and how it's often referred to in casual conversation, Lateral Thinking involves taking an idea that's prevalent in one vertical, and applying it to a new one.
    i.e. The Z thumbstick in the Nintendo 64 controller took the joystick from arcade games and applied it to consoles.
      > You cannot dig a hole in a different place by digging the same hole deeper. Vertical thinking is used to dig the same hole deeper. Lateral thinking is used to dig a hole in a different place.

      > Description is certainly the easiest setting in which to practise lateral thinking because there is always some result. [i.e. Sports Analogies used to describe business]

    * After further reading, I have come to understand Lateral Thinking as introduced by Edward de Bono.
    Often oversimplified to a brainstorm session, Lateral Thinking is a philosophy and thought process used to shake up existing patterns or assumptions,
    with the goal of coming up with new ones.
      > The purpose of thinking is not to be right but to be effective. Being effective does eventually involve being right but there is a very important difference between the two. Being right means being right all the time. Being effective means being right only at the end.

1. [A Technique for Producing Ideas](https://smile.amazon.com/technique-producing-ideas-simple-formula-ebook/dp/B0145R7R22/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3K7ZPFWKQERHA&keywords=a+technique+for+producing+ideas&qid=1577976266&s=digital-text&sprefix=a+technique+%2Cdigital-text%2C140&sr=1-1)

    * A 46 page book where author James Webb Young reversed-engineered his capacity for ingenuity, so that others could replicate his success.
    > an idea is nothing more nor less than a new combination of old elements.

    * Touches on Steve Job's quote, but with a twist:
    > Good artists copy; great artists steal [and add it to something else].

1. [Mindset](https://smile.amazon.com/Mindset-Psychology-Carol-S-Dweck/dp/0345472322/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=mindset&qid=1577970635&sr=8-3)

    * A fantastic, behavior-changing book advocating the growth mindset, and how to apply it to your personal life.
    > Benjamin Barber, an eminent political theorist, once said, “I don’t divide the world into the weak and the strong, or the successes and the failures….I divide the world into the learners and nonlearners.”

    * Breaks down the differences between fixed and growth mindsets, and how we all have both. Illustrates the power of a change in perspective. Focus on the journey of growth, rather than a destination that could be failure.

    * Adding ammunition for my inevitable battle against the philosophy of the "easy A", where one drops a real challenge to pad their stats:
    > Wasn’t the IQ test meant to summarize children’s unchangeable intelligence? In fact, no. Binet, a Frenchman working in Paris in the early twentieth century, designed this test to identify children who were not profiting from the Paris public schools, so that new educational programs could be designed to get them back on track.

1. [Anti-Intellectualism in American Life](https://smile.amazon.com/Anti-Intellectualism-American-Life-Richard-Hofstadter-ebook/dp/B006LSVB1M/ref=sr_1_1?crid=7JF2N2XV6UVM&keywords=antiintellectualism+in+american+life&qid=1577972451&s=digital-text&sprefix=antiintellec%2Cdigital-text%2C136&sr=1-1)
    > The Sputnik was more than a shock to American national vanity: it brought an immense amount of attention to bear on the consequences of anti-intellectualism in the school system and in American life at large. Suddenly the national distaste for intellect appeared to be not just a disgrace but a hazard to survival.

    * Trump's election and the resulting change in America's image triggered some personal introspection, which led me to this book. Rest assured, America has seen much of this before. What remains to be seen is how technology will affect it.
    > Anti-intellectualism was not manifested in this country for the first time during the 1950’s. Our anti-intellectualism is, in fact, older than our national identity, and has a long historical background.

    * An incredibly prescient book that shows this populist movement isn't unique in history, and, like so much of America, is the result of a swinging pendulum, a recurring ebb and flow.
    > An examination of this background suggests that regard for intellectuals in the United States has not moved steadily downward and has not gone into a sudden, recent decline, but is subject to cyclical fluctuations; it suggests, too, that the resentment from which the intellectual has suffered in our time is a manifestation not of a decline in his position but of his increasing prominence.

    * Anti-intellectualism should not be misinterpreted as the love by or of idiots. Businessmen, advocated of old ideas, and champions of pragmatism exercise anti-intellectualism, sometimes correctly so.
    > Quite the contrary: just as the most effective enemy of the educated man may be the half-educated man, so the leading anti-intellectuals are usually men deeply engaged with ideas, often obsessively engaged with this or that outworn or rejected idea.

    * A heavy academic read, that probably won't be finished by most who start it.

1. [Talking to Strangers](https://smile.amazon.com/Talking-Strangers-Should-about-People-ebook/dp/B07NDKVWZW/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=talking+to+strangers&qid=1577971943&s=digital-text&sr=1-1)
    * Another Malcolm Gladwell journey that helps to analyze some of the more modern catastrophes in judgement, ranging from Sandra Brand to Amanda Knox. Using current events and case studies
    to illustrate a particular facet of global human judgement, he explains our inefficacy at talking to strangers because of three verticals:

        1. Defaulting to truth.
            * Defaulting to skepticism would lead civilization to a standstill. Progress favors trust.
        2. Illusion of Transparency.
            * We all think we can read people, but we can't.
        3. Coupling of thoughts to actions.
            * In SF and Seattle, suicidal thoughts lead to jumping off a bridge. Will removing the bridge just lead people to find other ways of suicide? Many studies say no.

1. [Unlimited Memory](https://smile.amazon.com/Unlimited-Memory-Advanced-Strategies-Productive-ebook/dp/B00I3QS1XQ/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=2CIHW7SC36ING&keywords=unlimited+memory&qid=1577973509&s=digital-text&sprefix=unlimited+%2Cdigital-text%2C136&sr=1-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFVSjZQVDFZVlRCV0ImZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTA1MDM0NTMzVTNHSEpTTlowWkFJJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA2NTgzODIzRzhCV01DNUdMMVlMJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==)

    * Written by an international grandmaster of memory, Kevin Horsley walks through techniques for improving your memory.
    * Leveraging your Visual IQ in creative ways, even if what you want to remember is auditory or text.
    > As neuroscientist John Medina says, “Hear a piece of information and three days later you’ll remember 10% of it. Add a picture and you’ll remember 65%.”

    > “Interest level is measured by how much you remember.” ~ Philip A. Bossert

    * I'm honestly surprised this wasn't covered with more emphasis in middle school and highschool. Maybe it was and I ignored it.

1. [Measure What Matters](https://smile.amazon.com/Measure-What-Matters-Google-Foundation-ebook/dp/B078FZ9SYB/ref=sr_1_2?crid=S0IFK8IMA96G&keywords=measure+what+matters&qid=1577974582&s=digital-text&sprefix=measure+what%2Cdigital-text%2C134&sr=1-2)

    > The practice that molded me at Intel and saved me at Sun—that still inspires me today—is called OKRs. Short for Objectives and Key Results.

    * OKRs: Objective and Key Results. A goal tracking and managerial process to help align goals horizontally (at different levels of seniority) and vertically (across roles and functions).
    * A mix of insight and case studies, John Doerr walks you through implementing your own OKRs in your org. More appropriate for larger companies that need to
    coordinate up and down the ranks, and across verticals. Transparency and accountability being the key ingredient.
    > Many companies have a “rule of seven,” limiting managers to a maximum of seven direct reports. In some cases, Google has flipped the rule to a minimum of seven. (When Jonathan Rosenberg headed Google’s product team, he had as many as twenty.) The higher the ratio of reports, the flatter the org chart—which means less top-down oversight, greater frontline autonomy, and more fertile soil for the next breakthrough. OKRs help make all of these good things possible.

    * Interseting tidbit on the personalities originall sought by old school Intel:
    > At Intel, Andy recruited “aggressive introverts” in his own image, people who solved problems quickly, objectively, systematically, and permanently. Following his lead, they were skilled at confronting a problem without attacking the person. They set politics aside to make faster, sounder, more collective decisions.
