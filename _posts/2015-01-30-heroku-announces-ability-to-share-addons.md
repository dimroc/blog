Everytime I think I'm going to move off of Heroku for some fancy [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
setup, they announce something that pulls me back.

First it was the [metrics dashboard](https://blog.heroku.com/archives/2014/8/5/new-dashboard-and-metrics-beta) and now it's the
[ability to share add ons across apps](https://blog.heroku.com/archives/2015/1/23/expanding_the_power_of_add_ons).

This allows one to share a service between their own personal apps, easing the transition to a microservice architecture. All
with great metrics of course.

Well done.
