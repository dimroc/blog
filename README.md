# About

Blog using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and the [Lanyon theme](https://github.com/poole/lanyon).

## Setup

Has cross posting to medium capabilities that are ironically never used but requires environment variables:

```
export MEDIUM_INTEGRATION_TOKEN=sometoken
export MEDIUM_USER_ID=someuserid
```

I place these in .envrc.


### Running

```
jekyll serve --drafts
```


### Deploy

```
rake deploy
```
