The following books have changed my day to day professional life. All worthy of a read
and not for any obscure academic purpose. They all live somewhere in the union of business,
writing and technology.

* How to win friends and influence people
* Never eat alone
* Zero to One
* Innovator's Dilemma
* Bargaining for Advantage
* The hard thing about hard things
* Liar's Poker
* On Writing: Stephen King
* The Elements of Style: Strunk and White
